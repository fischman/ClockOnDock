ClockOnDock - automatically launch the Android clock when the phone is charging.
===========

> **NOTE**: ClockOnDock is obsoleted by Android 4.2, where you can simply say
> `Settings -> Display -> Daydream -> WHEN TO DAYDREAM -> While charging`
> (after making sure the `Daydream` setting is set to `Clock`).
> I'm extremely unlikely to do any work to ClockOnDock now that the functionality is included in stock Android.

There are no UI, settings, or permissions required.
Simply install the .apk and watch the clock get launched whenever the device is plugged in (AC or USB).

NOTE: the clock package name is device-specific, so if you want to use this app but it's not working on your device, please let me know the device, OS version, and any chatter from logcat about the Clock emitted when you start the Clock app from the launcher.

To just use this without having to rebuild from source, download the [apk](https://github.com/fischman/ClockOnDock/blob/master/bin/ClockOnDock.apk?raw=true)
